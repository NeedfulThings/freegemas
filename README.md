# Free Gemas for Mac & iOS

Gosu needs a nice example project to get people started with iOS development. Because this open source game is a pretty and reasonable porting candidate, I've decided to clean it up on OS X and then later port it to iOS. (It is not eligible for release on the App Store, this is all just for documenting the process, see below.)

# Work in Progress. TODO:

 * Fix CustomFont (needs resourcePrefix?)
 * Fix TextBlock (sdlfont.h)
 * Find/add gettext->Strings.plist converter?
 * Add iOS Xcode4 project and document it for the Gosu Wiki
 * Add touch interface
 * Flesh out this README

# Licensing

The original game has been licensed under the GPLv2. If it should ever be re-licensed under a more liberal license (MIT, BSD, zlib) all of my commits can be re-licensed without asking. E.g., to make an App Store version possible.
